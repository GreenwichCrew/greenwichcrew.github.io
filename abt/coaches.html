  text: 'Bert began rowing in high school at Salisbury school. Originally reluctant to start rowing after hearing it was a grueling sport, he eventually caved his junior year after seeing his physics teacher was a big time rower. During his first year, he was pulled from the novice squad and into the third varsity 8+ after a strong showing in workouts. His senior year, and second year rowing, he made the varsity 8+. This boat was the first Salisbury 8+ to make it to Nationals! That same year, they attended Henley Royal Regatta and made it to Friday. Upon graduating from Salisbury School, Bert attended Cornell University where he studied meteorology and information science, while also member of their lightweight team. His senior year they won the national championship, as well as finishing second place at Henley Royal Regatta in the Temple Challenge Cup. After sustaining a back injury, he was put on training hold and began coaching at Oakland Strokes, helping the team with their first two national championships. In addition, Bert helped the lightweight team win a national title in 2018. Bert joined the coaching staff at Greenwich Crew in the fall of 2019. In the spring of 2021, he coached the u17 Mens 8+ and youth 4- to their national title. Outside of rowing, Bert writes, records, and produces music under the name Redshiift.',
